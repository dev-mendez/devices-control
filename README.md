## Usage

***Instructions on how to use the project.***

There are two views, one is for the Master-devices and the other one is for the Slave-devices(Peripherals).
  The navigation between those views is fast, allowing the user to go back and forward between them easily.

*Master-devices
  The user can add as many Master-devices as he wants.
  The user can add Master-devices by clicking the button "Mount".
  The user can delete "Unmount" the Master-devices only if they don't have any peripheral associates.
  The user can add peripherals to the Master-devices by clicking the button "Peripherals" and then "Connect".
*Peripherals
  The user can add only ten peripherals into one Master-device.
  The peripherals can exist in two states, Stopped or Running.
  The peripherals can be created in status Stopped or Running, Stopped by default.
  The user can change the status of the peripherals by clicking the button "Stop/Run".
  The user can delete the peripherals by clicking the button "Disconnect", but it only will happen if the peripheral is Stopped.

## Testing

Testing is an important part of the development and maintenance of our application. We use a combination of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure the quality of our code, prevent bugs, and improve the overall reliability of the application.

### Testing Methodology

- **Unit tests / E2E test** We use Jest for this time.

### Running Tests

To run the tests for our application, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`, `yarn install` or `pnpm install` inside of each module Client/Server.
2. Inside the Client/Server folder run the test `npm run test` or `yarn test` or `pnpm test`.
